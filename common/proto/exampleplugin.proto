// For Example, the TaskTemplate contains the Container information. The container contains the command to be executed etc. The container also contains cpu, memory requirements.
// But if additional information is needed then it can be passed in this proto, an example would be Spark Plugin in Flyte. The user needs to pass additional configuration for Spark or Hadoop drivers,
// which is not covered in the TaskTemplate, so the Spark plugin definition encapsulates this
